The data found within this repository is the output of analysis in "Analyzing the Usability of a Global Statistically Downscaled Dataset for Projecting Future Precipitation in Guam and Tutuila (in progress)". This data is made available in hopes that users will find this data helpful in visualizing and understanding future climate change, specifically future precipitation patterns. 

Climatologies at high resolution for the Earthâ€™s land surface areas (CHELSA) statistically downscaled, high resolution (~1km) projections of precipitation are processed to the extent of Tutuila, American Samoa and Guam. Dynamically downscaled climate projections from Zhang and Wang, et al., (2016) have been processed to the extent of Tutuila and Guam as well. Future Percent Change in Precipitation was calculated for CHELSA CMIP5 and CMIP6 products for precipitation, as well as Zhang and Wang precipitation projections. The output raster files of future percent change are located here with the scripts that were used to develop them. Please visit the American Samoa Climate Data Portal 'Future Climate Projections Page' for more information.
